I can stick around
`Cos here`s funky town
And here`s A Wild Tom Cat
(He is a Wild Tom Cat)
Another tea is free
He`ll be up to me
And here`s A Wild Tom Cat
(They call him `Wild Tom Cat`)

Hey, Hey, Hey
Soon He`ll be knocking at my door
(He is a Wild Tom Cat)
Hey, Hey, Hey
Please, don`t be just like before
(He is a Wild Tom Cat)

Tom Cat, Tom Cat
you make me fall again
Tom Cat, Tom Cat
I can`t resist that man

What ... mean
He`s a full of grim
You call him Wild Tom Cat
We call him `Wild Tom Cat`

You can`t hold me long
Empty wase in front
And here`s A Wild Tom Cat
(He is a Wild Tom Cat)

Hey, Hey, Hey
What am I waiting for
(He is a Wild Tom Cat)
Hey, Hey, Hey
I shouldn`t see him anymore
(He is a Wild Tom Cat)

Tom Cat, Tom Cat
I hear his footsteps now
Tom Cat, Tom Cat
And jump for joy somehow

Tom Cat, Tom Cat
He is a Wild Tom Cat
Tom Cat, Tom Cat
They call him `Wild Tom Cat`
